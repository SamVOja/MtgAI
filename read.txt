MKM is one of the sets in Magic: The Gathering and is the only one used in 
this program, but using the tools provided here other sets can also be
processed to work with the program.
format_card_data.py: processes set data to create "MKM_filtered.json"
Create_Weights.py: creates heuristic initial weights "MKM_weights.json"


1. run format_training_data.py (needs draft_data...csv)
        Asks how much data to process
        creates file "training.sqlite"

2. run trainmodel.py       
        creates file "MKM_learned_weights.json"
        Analyze_training.py plots loss

3. run simulate_draft.py
        Asks how many drafts to simulate
        Analyze_simulations.py is ran immeadiately instead of saving the results
